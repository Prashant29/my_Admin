			<span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;">Android apps live in a highly fragmented multi-device world. The API rules are less strict, but quality assurance testing is more intensive. We handle it. We&rsquo;ve developed hundreds of cool Android apps on releases from 2.X to 5.X. From Gingerbread to Lollipop, simple phones to custom devices to Android wearables &mdash; we&rsquo;ve done it all.</span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;">Develop powerful, highly usable Android apps that solve business problems, attract users, and reinforce your brand. </span></p>
